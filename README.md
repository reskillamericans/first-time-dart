# First time Dart | Online Tutorials for New Programmers

*A collection of on-line tutorials for first-time programmers learning the Dart language.*

These tutorials should be viewed from this site:

> https://reskillamericans.github.io/first-time-dart/


in order to practice interactive coding and watch the associated videos.

These tutorials can be viewed completely in the web browser using the [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/)
web site run by the Dart Language group.

The inspiration for the structure is the decades-old classic text [The C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language).

These tutorials are designed to be accessible to someone who has not done *any* programming
before.  They will introduce concepts progressively until you have all the tools to independently
write programs in Dart.

The final sections describe how to install Dart on your computer and use VSCode to edit
compile and run Dart programs from your own computer.
