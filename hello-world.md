# Hello, World!

The most common first program that programmers write when they begin
a new programming language is the traditional, "hello, world" program.

The goal is to get you programming with the simplest program that
does *something*, which you can build from as you learn more
language features.

In these tutorials, you will not have to install anything on your
computer, as we will be using an embedded text editor that can
help you edit and format your code, and run the examples.
